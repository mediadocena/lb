# LoopBack AngularJS SDK

**⚠️ LoopBack 3 is in Maintenance LTS mode, only critical bugs and critical
security fixes will be provided. (See
[Module Long Term Support Policy](#module-long-term-support-policy) below.)**

We urge all LoopBack 3 users to migrate their applications to LoopBack 4 as
soon as possible. Refer to our
[Migration Guide](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/migration-overview.html)
for more information on how to upgrade.

## Overview

The JavaScript AngularJS SDK provides an API based on
[ngResource.$resource](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource.$resource)
that enable your AngularJS app to access a
[LoopBack](http://loopback.io) server application.

The client is dynamic, in other words it automatically includes all the
LoopBack models and methods you've defined on your server.
You don't have to manually write any static code.

See the official [LoopBack AngularJS SDK
documentation](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/AngularJS-JavaScript-SDK.html)
for more information.
